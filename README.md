# Online-Examination-System
Higher Secondary School Final project

This is an Online Examination System done as a part of my Higher Secondary School Main Project.
 It consists of two levels,
     - administer Level 
     - Student level
   In Administer Level, we can add questions with four differnt options and can also set the correct option.
   In Student Level, we can view the questions along with their four different options and we are suppose to choose the correct option.
   Also,new students are required to create their login first and they have the options to reset their passwords.
   
   At the end of the exam,Induvidal Scores as well as the final result will be displayed.
   
   NOTE :U HAVE TO MAKE A TEXT FILE EXAMSECURITY.TXT IN WHICH U HAVE TO WRITE "STUDENT NAME"
         THIS WILL BE THE ADMINISTRATOR USENAME AND PASSWORD WHEN THE PROGRAM WILL ASK FOR ADMIN USERNAME AND PASSWORD THAN IT WILL CHECK FROM THIS FILE.
